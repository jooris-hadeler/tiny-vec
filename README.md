# Tiny-Vec
Tiny-Vec provides a Vec-like datastructure which stores a certain number of elements on the stack, and moves them to the heap on overflow.

## How to use?
Since there are already simmilarly named crates on crates.io, I decided to keep this on github only.
If you want to use this instead crate instead of a similar one from crates.io you can do so like this:

```bash
$ cargo add --git https://github.com/jooris-hadeler/tiny-vec.git
```
